We used a 5-way-cross-validation to test our algorithm.
go_adaboost.m	0.84%	Vectorization of text reviews: Histogram.
						An adaboost algorithm with 700 iterations, where the weak classifier is "whether a given word exists in the text".
						(An attempt has been made to count sentences with negation words as negative words - that is, reducing from the
						histogram instead of increasing - but it didn't go well).
