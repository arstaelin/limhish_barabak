Ideas:
*) matlab nlp library ( should have stemming :D )
*) also take into account length (bad reviews are shorter?)
*) use word2vec to get more data from words
*) try higher level nlp things
*) look at word pairs and more

What we have done so far:
*) wrote 'general' code (read files and vectorize, do cross val)
*) wrote basic vectorizing code (just hash each word)
*) tried svm on basic vectorizing, got ~70% accuracy
